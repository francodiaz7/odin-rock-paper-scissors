## Thoughts

Third project assignment with The Odin Project curriculum. I already knew a bit about JavaScript so it was very straightforward, nonetheless it was very fun to code and practice. For the time being this project only works via console so I consider it incomplete. Can't wait to make a GUI for the game in Html.
